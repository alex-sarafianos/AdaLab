\section{Model and experiment space declarations}

Declarations should be constructed for the \textit{model space} and \textit{experiment space}.  These specifications may be refined during the project, it is essential to have a repository which always has the most recent specifications suppoirted by all modules (and possibly experimental versions not yet supported by all modules).

This document will represent specifications in logic (prolog facts),
there are some specific formalisms around, e.g., for gene regulatory networks,
but they are not always compatible with each other nor sufficiently general to
incorporate everything we want to model.
Nevertheless, during implementation more suitable representations could be developed.

\subsection{Experiment space}

An environemt state is a data structure representing the state of the environment at a certain time point.  This includes amongst others the concentration of compounds (sugar, alcohol, ...) and temperature (see technical documents).  

The specification of an experiment is a tuple $expSpec(InitEnv,IncEnv,Strain,Output)$ where
\begin{enumerate}
\item $InitEnv$ is the initial environment state
\item $IncEnv$ is a function which gives for each time point $t$ the external changes to the environment, such as addition of compounds (sugar, alcohol, ...) and increase/decrease of temperature.
\item $Strain$ is the strain used (e.g., knocked out genes)
\item $Output$ is a list of measurements made during the experiment, e.g., a point on the growth curve every 20 minutes, the amount of sugar at the end.
\end{enumerate}

The experiment space declaration is a set of statements defining this data structure in more detail, e.g.

\begin{verbatim}
experiment_specification(exampleExpSpec).
expSpec_initEnv(exampleExpSpec, Feature, ValueRange) :-
   envStateSpec(exampleEnvStateSpec, Feature, ValueRange).
expSpec_incEnv(exampleExpSpec, addComp(Compound, Amount)) :- 
   member(Compound, [sugar,alcohol]), 
   member(Amount,[1,2,3,4]). % in vol%
expSpec_incEnv(exampleExpSpec, deltaTemp(DT)) :-
   member(DT,[-1,1]). % in degrees Celsius
expSpec_envState(exampleExpSpec, exampleEnvStateSpec).
expSpec_output(exampleExpSpec, Time, yeastGrowth(Time)) :- 
   Time = 20 
   ; expSpec_output(exampleExpSpec, PrevTime, yeastGrowth(PrevTime)),
     Time is PrevTime + 20. % in minutes
expSpec_strain(exampleExpSpec, exampleStrainSpec).

envStateSpec(exampleEnvStateSpec, temp, real(0,40)).
envStateSpec(exampleEnvSTateSpec, sugarConc, real(0,1)).

strainSpec(exampleStrainSpec, knockOut(Gene), bool) :-
   member(Gene, [gene1, gene2]).
strainSpec(exampleStrainSpec, greyScale(Gene), real(0,1,Resolution)) :-
   member(Gene, [gene3, gene4]), Resolution=0.1.
\end{verbatim}

{\small{For those not familiar with prolog, it is easy from the above the ``ground'' these specifications, i.e. writing them as instantiated facts.  Those liking lifted inference can keep the implicit clauses.}}

We will denote experiment spaces with $\expspace$.

\subsection{Model space}

The state of an experiment is a triple $S=state(Strain, YeastState, EnvState)$ (1) strain information, (2) the state of the yeast (gene expression levels, metabolite concentrations, ...) and (3) the environment (temperature, concentration of compounds, ...)

The model describes how the state of an experiment evolves over time.
An experiment $Exp$ starts at time $0$.
If the specification of the experiment $Exp$ is $expSpec(InitEnv,IncEnv,Strain,Output)$, then $state(Exp,0)$

The model space declaration defines the parameters of the model.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
modelSpec(exampleModelSpec).
modelSpec_strain(exampleModelSpec, exampleStrainSpec). 
modelSpec_parameter(exampleModelSpec, geneRegulateEdge(G1,G2), real(-1,1,0.1)) :-
   % +1 is upregulation, -1 is inhibition
   exampleModelGene(G1), exampleModelGene(G2).
modelSpec_parameter(exampleModelSpec, geneTempRegulate(G1), real(-1,1,0.1)) :-
   % for genes influenced by the temperature:
   % strength of regulation is the (temperature minus 20Celsius)
   % times the value of this parameter.
   exampleModelGene(G1).

exampleModelGene(gene1).
exampleModelGene(gene2).
exampleModelGene(gene3).
exampleModelGene(gene4).
\end{verbatim}

We will denote model spaces with $\modelspace$.

\subsection{Cost and objective functions}

We laos have declarations of the cost of experiments, e.g.,

\begin{verbatim}
expCost(exampleExpSpec,newknockoutStrain, 100).
expCost(exampleExpSpec,newGreyScaleStrain, 1000).
expCost(exampleExpSpec,experiment, 1).
expCost(exampleExpSpec,initEnv(Feature, Value), 0) :-
   expSpec_initEnv(exampleExpSpec, Feature, ValueRange),
   acceptable_value(ValueRange, Value). 
   % let's assume that all value ranges are finite due to 
   % (possibly fine) discretization.
expCost(exampleExpSpec,incEnv(addComp(Compound,Amount), 0.5).
\end{verbatim}

and we need a loss function to compare two experiment outpouts (a predicted and actual one).

\subsection{Experimental observation database}

Initial experimental conditions is a data structure specifying the initial values of all variables declared in the experiment initialisation space, which is a part of the experiment specification space described above.

An experiment update strategy is a data structure specifying as a function of time the changes to the environment performed during the experiment.  This data structure should contain updates in the space of experiment updates, which is a part of the experiment space described above.

An experiment input is a tuple $expInput(ExpInit,ExpInc)$
where $ExpInit$ is an initial experimental condition
and $ExpInc$ is an experiment environment update strategy.

An experiment output is an assignment of values to all measurements declared in the experiment output space, which is a part of the experiment specification space described above.

Once experiments are performed, a database can be constructed consisting of
pairs $(ExpInput,ExpOutput)$.

\subsection{Model probability distribution spaces}
\label{sec:modProbDist}
Given a declaration of a model space $\modelspace$ as described above, one can also define a probability space $\probmodelspace$ over $\modelspace$.
Even though inference algorithms can use internally any apropriate
probability distributions, one can restrict priors over model space
to independent priors on all the parameters, e.g. a prior could be specified as

\begin{verbatim}
model_prior(exampleModelPrior, geneRegulateEdge(G1,G2), [0.1:0,0.9:1]) :- 
   zimmerman(edge(G1,G2)).
model_prior(exampleModelPrior, geneRegulateEdge(G1,G2), [0.95:0,0.05:1]) :- 
   not(zimmerman(edge(G1,G2))).
model_prior(exampleModelPrior, geneTempRegulate(G1), [0.05:-1,0.05:-0.5,0.8:0,0.05:0.5,0.05:1]).
\end{verbatim}

A disadvantage of this strategy is that it may insufficiently take into account
\begin{itemize}
\item the prior that simpler models are more likely.
\item local patterns of which one could estimate the frequence by pattern mining (e.g. cyclicly directed triangles are unlikely).
\end{itemize}

\section{Adalab system components}

\subsection{Simulator}
The simulator takes as input:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a model space declaration
\item a compatible experiment space declaration
\item experiment initial conditions (consistent with the environment initialization space and strain space defined)
\item experiment environment updates (consistent with the environment increment space defined).
\end{enumerate}

and returns a set of values with the structure defined by the experiment output space declaration.


An additional argument can be provided to the simulator, specifying uncertainty on the model (see e.g. Section \ref{sec:modProbDist}).  In that case, the simulator will simulate several times, sampling from the model probability distribution.  


\subsection{Model parameter estimation}

A model parameter estimation algorithm is an algorithm taking as input
\begin{enumerate}
\item a declaration of a model space $\modelspace$.
\item a declaration of a compatible experiment space $\expspace$
\item a model space prior $P_{prior}$
\item a database of experimental observations $D$.
\end{enumerate}

and outputs a set of model parameters which best explains the observations under the model space prior, e.g.
$\hbox{argmax}_{m\in\modelspace} P_{prior}(m)P(D|m)$

Many different strategies are plausible, a naive one would just perform a hill climbing (in continuous or discrete space).



\subsection{Experiment selection}

An experiment selection algorithm takes as input


A model parameter estimation algorithm is an algorithm taking as input
\begin{enumerate}
\item a declaration of a model space $\modelspace$.
\item a declaration of a compatible experiment space $\expspace$
\item a model space prior $P_{prior}$
\item a database of earlier experimental observations $D$.
\item an experiment cost function definition
\item a loss function
\end{enumerate}

and outputs a list of experiments which will be most informative / cost-efficient.

One (common) strategy could be to sample from the experiment space, and select the experiment which is most cost-effective and most different from earlier selected experiments.

Ways to determine the informativeness of experiments could include e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item the variation of experiment results around the selected experiment (e.G. by simulating the experiment with a bit of noise on the model).
\item an experiment between two experiments with different outcomes.
\end{itemize}
